# Youtuber-Age-Gate-Content-Categorization
A GitHub repository that categorizes content on YouTube based on the age gate for various countries using data preprocessing, data import, Spark processing, and visualization with Tableau.
This project aims to categorize the content published on Youtube based on the age gate for respective countries. The objective is to ensure that the content is suitable for all age groups and to understand its impact on different age groups. The business requirements include classifying the content into appropriate categories, tracking the viewing habits of different age groups, and creating a dashboard to visualize the content categories, data and allow for easy analysis.

The process involves preprocessing the data using Python, importing the data into HDFS, and using MySQL to get the CSV data into tables. Spark is then used to process the data and the partitioned data is uploaded to Hive. Finally, the end CSV files are imported into Tableau to visualize and create the final dashboard. This dashboard provides insights into the viewing habits of different age groups and helps the business to publish the right ads to the right people.
